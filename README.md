# Portfolio Draft #1 - Grid Demo
In this repo you will find the first version of my professional portfolio. Each section will be updated as I develop my Web Development skills and knowledge. 

The aim of this portfolio is to showcase my level of understanding of web development and the practical skills I have acquired. The main objective here is to showcase a mobile-first responsive web app. 

This is achieved by using the ```grid-template-area``` property in the CSS code like so, 

(screenshot of grid-template-area) 

In order to make the web app responsive I have used ```@media``` to target screen size of less than 600 pixels. Once this condition is met in the browser, the web app will respond by changing the layout of the Work section into single-line rows as shown below.

## Installation

There is no installation required. Simply open the ```index.html``` file in your default browser to view the page. 

## Usage

To navigate the portfolio you can use the Navbar at the top of the page to jump to another section. In the work section of the portfolio, the Images are linked to the HTML file and will open once clicked. 

The "CV" button on the Navbar downloads a ```.txt```file containing "Not a CV - test" Th is only to demonstrate my understanding of how to allow certain ```<a>``` elements to download a file to your local device.
